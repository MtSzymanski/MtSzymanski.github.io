<p>You know my name now, the other thing to know is that I like maths (specifically abstract algebra!).</p>
<p> Another thing to know about me is that I play guitar; here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/c9stZ46EUys?si=bHg4m-vVxv40WD-x" target="_blank">link</a> to me playing a piece.</p>
<p>Below is a poem by Albert Camus which I really like (it is called <cite>Within Me</cite>):</p>
<blockquote>
In the midst of hate, I found there was,
<br>
within me, an invincible love.
<br>
<br>
In the midst of tears, I found there was,
<br>
within me, an invincible smile.
<br>
<br>
In the midst of chaos, I found there was,
<br>
within me, an invincible calm…
<br>
<br>

In the midst of winter, I found there was,
<br>
within me, an invincible summer.
<br><br>

And that makes me happy. For it says that<br>
no matter how hard the world pushes against me,<br><br>

within me, there’s something stronger –<br>
something better, pushing right back.
</blockquote>
